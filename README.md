# M13_Plotly
Module 13: Plotly

## Overview

In this project, I helped Roza create a dashboard to visualize the results of 153 research participants in a study on Bellybutton Biodiversity. 

## Results

Participants can visit the website afsharritter.github.io/M13_Plotly/ to view the data from their study. After selecting their Participant ID Number, they will be presented with three graphs showing their results. The bar graph shows the top 10 bacterial species found in their navel region. The bubble graph displays all of the bacterial species present and their respective quantities. The gauge meter shows the number of times each participant reported to wash their navel. 

## Summary 

This website allows for participants to directly view the results of this study. Hopefully this will incentivize these individuals to participate in future studies, since they have direct access to the data obtained from their belly buttons! Additionally, one would hope that this information brings attention to particants' hygiene habits and will incentivize those who wash their bellybuttons less frequently to increase the number of times they scrub every week. 

While the website allows for participants to view the types of bacteria present in their navel regions individually, it does not provide a "bigger-picture" as to the types of bacteria found among all participants. One recommendation is to perform further analysis that shows the most common bacterial species found among all participants. Additionally, I would be interested in seeing what effect, if any, washing frequency has on the number or types of bacteria present.
